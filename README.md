# Plumbing the Big Data Pipeline
(c) 2015 by Joseph Clark

These are my course notes (under development) for CIS 355, "Business Data Warehouses and Dimensional Modeling", which I have conceived -- more broadly than the name implies -- as a data engineering class that looks at the whole pipeline from data ingest to transformation, loading into databases, and serving to the world via applications and services.

Feel free to use this for education and training purposes, as long as you give me credit.
